Change color of drone lasers

sonar/auto sonar(any drone, needs cyclops sonar module)

scan stuffs(exploration drone/ion drone)

repair stuffs(exploration drone/ion drone, needs cyclops repair bay module)

teleport(ion drone) can go through walls and has no cooldown if in creative, drains 5 energy per teleport

drill(industrial drone/ion)

tractor beam(industrial drone/ion)

place beacon(exploration drone/ion) takes a beacon from the cyclops internal storage, or the player inventory if none are available from storage. Does not take a beacon if in creative

shield(ion drone, needs cyclops shield modules)

Second drone key - if both exploration and industrial drone are equipped, press this key to use the exploration drone

Drone energy usage type - 
		All: all energy usage comes from the drones battery. 
		Some: only energy usage from movement comes from the drones battery, the rest drain the cyclops battery directly. 
		None: Cyclops batteries constantly recharge the drone
		
Fuck Auto Stabilization - turns off the auto stabilization of all camera drones

Has cyclops hud icons to show the time left for cooldown on using drone

Cooldown is based off of damage taken while controlling drone. It takes the cyclops 100 seconds to fully repair a completely destroyed drone

two configs for flying - 
		can fly: allows use of the controls above water, drone is still affected by gravity though so you need you constantly move to keep it above water
		hovers above water: (requires the can fly config to be true) the drone is no longer affected by gravity above water
		
drone teleports back inside cyclops storage when not used

does not require drone in inventory to use, upgrade modules comes with one that is repaired

After exiting the drone, the cyclops will slowly (1 energy per second) recharge the drone back to full. If drone has 50% energy left when you exit, cyclops will drain 50 power to recharge

Drone is immune to stasis rifle 

scanning and repairing create a small icon in the bottom left of the screen as you look at something that can be scanned/repaired	
	these icons change color as you scan/repair the object. Scanning turhns red as you scan, repairing turns green as you repair
	
can collect databoxes by going up to them and hitting the scan key

ion drone can go through precursor forcefields

variable energy drain - increases power drain for movement based off of distance to cyclops, still affects drain even if infinite distance is on

infinite distance - gives the cyclops drone infinite distance so it doesn't fade to gray after some time

anything drilled/picked up by tracotr beam will now automatically be stored inside of the cyclops' downstairs internal lockers

with "None" selected as the energy usage type, power display shows available cyclops battery power rather than drone battery power

can not change cameras while controlling the cyclops drone
