## More Engine Efficiency Modules BZ

This mod re-adds the Engine Efficiency Module, and also adds a Mark 2 and Mark 3 Engine Efficiency Module for the PRAWN Suit.<br>
It also adds an option to have the Seatruck base efficiency slightly higher, incase you think it runs out slightly too fast in the early game.<br>
This is a port of More Engine Efficiency Modules for SN1, with slight changes so it works properly.
